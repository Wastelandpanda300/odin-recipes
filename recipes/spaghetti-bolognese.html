    <h4>A simple Bolognese recipe for excellent 
        chunky pasta sauce with beef, pork, lots of vegetables, and tons of flavor.</h4>

    <p>Lovely recipe for those cold night, where you crave a warm and filling food.</p>
    <p>This homemade Bolognese sauce is dedicated to the late great Marcella Hazan.
        She was considered the Julia Child of Italian food. At a time when most Americans
        thought Bolognese was spaghetti sauce with chunks of hamburger, Marcella taught us
        just how magnificent this meat sauce could be. I like to toss it with some mezzi
        rigatoni and serve it with a little grated Parmesan cheese and a sprinkle of parsley.</p>

    <ul><h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 large onion, minced</li>
        <li>4 slices bacon, cut into 1/2 inch pieces</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
    </ul>

    <ol><h3>Steps</h3>
        <li>Warm oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Saut√© onion, bacon, and garlic in hot
             oil until bacon is browned and crisp, about 10 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to transfer 
             bacon mixture to a paper towel-lined plate to drain; set aside.</li>
        <li>Place the same large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir ground beef and pork in 
            the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain and discard grease.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook in boiling 
            water until al dente, 8 to 10 minutes; drain.</li>
        <li>Serve sauce over hot pasta.</li>
    </ol>
